## About

**Evolution API** is a powerful, production-ready REST API for WhatsApp and multi-channel messaging. Originally focused on WhatsApp, it has grown into a comprehensive platform supporting multiple messaging providers and integrations.

Today, Evolution API supports both the Baileys-based WhatsApp Web API and the official WhatsApp Cloud API, plus integrations with Typebot, Chatwoot, Dify, OpenAI, RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Amazon SQS, Socket.io, Amazon S3 / MinIO, and more.

Evolution API began as a WhatsApp controller API based on [CodeChat](https://github.com/code-chat-br/whatsapp-api), which in turn implemented the [Baileys](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys) library. We continue to acknowledge CodeChat for laying the groundwork.

## Part of the Evolution Foundation ecosystem

Evolution API is one of the messaging engines maintained by Evolution Foundation. It is used as a WhatsApp provider by the [Evo CRM Community](https://github.com/evolution-foundation/evo-crm-community) and other projects in the ecosystem.

---

## Connection Types

Evolution API supports multiple connection types to WhatsApp:

### WhatsApp API — Baileys
A free API based on WhatsApp Web, leveraging the [Baileys library](https://github.com/WhiskeySockets/Baileys). Suitable for multi-service chats, service bots, and WhatsApp-integrated systems. Note: this method relies on the web version of WhatsApp and may have limitations compared to official APIs.

### WhatsApp Cloud API
The official API provided by Meta. Designed for businesses with higher messaging volumes and stronger integration support, including end-to-end encryption, advanced analytics, and customer service tools. Requires compliance with Meta's policies and may incur per-message costs.

---

## Integrations

Evolution API integrates natively with many platforms:

- **[Typebot](https://typebot.io/)** — conversational bots with trigger management
- **[Chatwoot](https://www.chatwoot.com/)** — customer service platform
- **[RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/)** — event streaming via AMQP
- **[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)** — real-time event streaming and processing
- **[Amazon SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)** — cloud-based message queuing
- **[Socket.io](https://socket.io/)** — real-time WebSocket events
- **[Dify](https://dify.ai/)** — AI agent workflows
- **[OpenAI](https://openai.com/)** — AI capabilities including audio-to-text conversion
- **[MiniMax](https://www.minimaxi.com/)** — chat completion via MiniMax M2.5 / M2.5-highspeed (OpenAI-compatible API)
- **Amazon S3 / [MinIO](https://min.io/)** — media file storage

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+
- **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**
- **Redis** (recommended for caching)

### Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:evolution-foundation/evolution-api.git
cd evolution-api

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database, Redis, and API key
```

### Database setup

```bash
# Set the database provider
export DATABASE_PROVIDER=postgresql  # or mysql

# Generate Prisma client
npm run db:generate

# Deploy migrations
npm run db:deploy
```

### Running

```bash
# Development with hot reload
npm run dev:server

# Production build and run
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

### Docker

```bash
docker pull evoapicloud/evolution-api:latest
docker run -p 8080:8080 --env-file .env evoapicloud/evolution-api:latest
```

## License Activation

Starting from **v2.4.0**, every Evolution API instance must be activated
against the Evolution Foundation licensing server before serving API
traffic. While unactivated, business endpoints return
`HTTP 503 LICENSE_REQUIRED` with a `register_url` pointing to the manager
UI.

There are two ways to activate:

1. **Set a known licensing key** as `AUTHENTICATION_API_KEY` in your
   `.env`. The server validates it on boot, persists it locally and
   activates the instance silently.
2. **Activate via the manager UI** at `https://<your-host>/manager/login`.
   On first login the manager detects an unlicensed backend and redirects
   you to the registration server; once you complete the form you are
   redirected back and the dashboard becomes accessible.

Activation is a one-time operation — the key is persisted in the
`RuntimeConfig` table and reused across restarts. The licensing server is
only consulted again for fire-and-forget heartbeats (telemetry) and a
best-effort `/v1/deactivate` notice on graceful shutdown.

Full activation guide: <https://docs.evolutionfoundation.com.br/licensing>

## Architecture

Evolution API is built with a multi-provider, event-driven architecture:

```
Client / CRM
     ↓
Evolution API
  ├── Channel Integrations (Baileys / Cloud API)
  ├── Chatbot Integrations (Typebot, Chatwoot, OpenAI, Dify, Flowise, N8N)
  ├── Event Integrations (WebSocket, RabbitMQ, SQS, NATS, Pusher)
  └── Storage Integrations (S3, MinIO)
```

Built with **Node.js 20+**, **TypeScript 5+**, and **Express.js**, it provides extensive integrations with chatbots, CRM systems, and messaging platforms.

### Multi-database support
PostgreSQL and MySQL via Prisma ORM with provider-specific schemas and migrations.

### Authentication
- API key-based authentication via `apikey` header
- Instance-specific tokens for WhatsApp connection authentication
- Webhook signature validation for external integrations

### Message queue support
RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, NATS, Pusher and WebSocket for events. Configurable per instance.

### Media handling
Local storage or S3/MinIO. Automatic media download from WhatsApp. Optional audio transcription via OpenAI.
