# evolution-in-purple

## 0.1.4 (2026-11-05)

### Fixes

* **Sent message status**: messages sent by the instance now advance `Message.status` from WhatsApp acks instead of staying `PENDING`, so `findChats` `lastMessageStatus` and `findMessages` reflect the real status. Applies to 1:1 chats; Baileys delivers no per-message status for groups. Backward acks are ignored and `DELETED`/`EDITED` are never overwritten (#36)
* **QR code limit**: unpaired instances whose QR code limit is reached now end in `close` (memory and database) instead of staying `connecting`, so requesting the QR code again starts a fresh connection (#37)
* **Deleted messages resent on retry**: messages deleted for everyone are no longer resent when a device sends a retry receipt, so deleted content no longer reappears. Incoming revokes now mark the stored message `DELETED` and record a `DELETED` message update; the `MESSAGES_DELETE` webhook payload is unchanged (#38)
* **Instance-scoped chat and edit lookups**: recalculating a chat's unread count and editing a sent message now only look up rows of the current instance, so another instance's chat or message with the same `remoteJid` or message id is no longer updated (#39)
* **Payload logging**: the Baileys channel no longer writes full message payloads (including media base64) to stdout on every received message, message update, call or history sync; these logs now go through the logger at `VERBOSE`/`DEBUG` level and include only ids and counts. Webhook payloads are unchanged (#41)
* **Event error isolation**: a failure while processing one message of a `messages.upsert` or `messages.update` batch no longer drops the rest of the batch and their webhooks, and a failing or ignored event type (for example a group `presence.update` with `groupsIgnore`, or a label event) no longer skips the other event types delivered with it. Webhook payloads and event order are unchanged (#42)
* **`@lid` remoteJidAlt**: history sync messages from `@lid` chats now store `key.remoteJidAlt`, and it is backfilled on stored messages when a lid mapping is learned; payload contacts with conflicting lids are skipped (#33, #34)
* **Archive and mark unread**: `archiveChat` and `markChatUnread` no longer fail with 500 when only `chat` is sent: the last message is looked up by JSON path on the jid built from the number, chats without stored messages can be archived, and the fallback timestamp is in seconds. Response shapes are unchanged (#43; based on the fix by Razario)

### Performance

* **Message lookup indexes**: PostgreSQL migrations add `idx_message_instance_key_id` (`instanceId`, `key->>'id'`) and `idx_message_instance_remotejid_fromme` (`instanceId`, `key->>'remoteJid'`, `key->>'fromMe'`) so message updates and read receipts no longer scan every message of the instance. They are created `IF NOT EXISTS` inside the migration transaction, which runs before the server starts, so databases that already have them are left untouched and a failed build leaves no invalid index (#40)

### Chores

* `scripts/` adds a one-off, row-locking backfill for `@lid` `key.remoteJidAlt` with backup and rollback (#35)
* The daily image scan fails on fixable CRITICAL or HIGH findings (#32)

## 0.1.3 (2026-10-24)

### Security

* **Image vulnerabilities**: the release image goes from 162 fixable CRITICAL/HIGH Trivy findings in 0.1.2 to **0 findings of any severity**, and `npm audit` reports 0 including development dependencies (#26, #27, #29, #30)
  * The image ships only production dependencies; `tsup` moves to devDependencies (#26)
  * Semver-compatible updates of production dependencies, including axios 1.20, express, undici, multer and ws (#27)
  * `@figuro/chatwoot-sdk` runs on the shared axios 1.x instead of axios 0.27.2 (#27)
  * sharp 0.35 and link-preview-js 4 (#27); node-cron 4; zod 4 for jimp and openai (#29)
  * `minio` is patched to run on query-string 10 and stream-json 3, verified against a SigV4-validating S3 server (#29)
  * The image runs without npm/npx: start scripts call node and prisma directly (#29)
  * vitest 5 and semver fixes for development tooling (#30)

### Fixes

* **Media mimetype**: sending media with a file name without a known extension no longer sets the mimetype to the string "false"; images keep `image/jpeg` and URL media keep the downloaded content type (#28)

### Chores

* CI builds the image and smoke-tests it against Postgres on every PR, checking the Node.js pin and that every migration applied (#24; adapted from @nogara)
* A daily Trivy scan reports findings in the latest released image to code scanning (#25; adapted from @nogara)

### Upgrade notes

* `npm` and `npx` are no longer available inside the container. Use `node` and `./node_modules/.bin/prisma` for manual operations.
* `zod` is overridden to 4 for jimp and openai; Evolution's OpenAI structured-output helpers are not used.

## 0.1.2 (2026-10-23)

### Features

* **onWhatsapp cache storage**: the cache moves to a new `IsOnWhatsappJid` table with one row per jid and an indexed canonical `remoteJid`. Lookups are two indexed queries and a 2,500-contact sync takes about 30 queries instead of ~5,000; writes are serialized per process. The migration is additive (the old `IsOnWhatsapp` table is kept, so an upstream image still runs) and backfills Postgres from `jidOptions` (#22)

### Fixes

* **Database pool exhaustion**: contact syncs no longer open thousands of concurrent onWhatsapp cache queries (#16)
* **Status updates without `remoteJid`**: `messages.update` takes the jid from the stored message, so the webhook carries it and `messageUpdate.create` no longer fails and aborts the batch (#17)
* **Group number changes**: plain-jid `messageStubParameters` no longer throw in `processMessage`, so `group-participants.update` is emitted (#18; Baileys patch)
* **Link previews without an image**: pages without an image get a title and description preview instead of none (#19; Baileys patch)
* **Telemetry**: disabled unless `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=true`; it sent every request path, including instance names, to `log.evolution-api.com` (#21, by @nogara)

### Chores

* Docker base image pinned to the official `node:24.22.1-alpine3.24` by digest (#20, by @nogara)

### Upgrade notes

* The image applies the new migration on start (`Docker/scripts/deploy_database.sh`); it only adds a table and backfills it.
* Set `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` where it is set to `true` explicitly in the environment, since #21 only changes the default.

## 0.1.1 (2026-10-22)

### Fixes

* **Logout state**: `logoutInstance` closes the connection state (401), persists it and sends `STATUS_INSTANCE` and `CONNECTION_UPDATE` immediately instead of ~40s later; `logout.instance` is emitted after the Session row is removed and the late Baileys close is ignored (#9)
* **Argentine JIDs**: `createJid` keeps the mobile 9 (`549…`); the third-digit removal now applies only to Mexico (#10)
* **"Waiting for this message"**: `getMessage` returns no message for unknown keys, so Baileys stops resending an empty message on retry receipts (#11; upstream evolution-foundation/evolution-api#2705, #2706, #1934)
* **Duplicate messages**: live `messages.upsert` stores and emits each message once per recipient, deduping redeliveries and `@lid`/phone copies through the baileys cache; history sync no longer re-stores live messages (#12; upstream evolution-foundation/evolution-api#2737, #2675)
* **onWhatsapp cache**: unique-constraint races in `saveOnWhatsappCache` retry and merge instead of dropping data, and cache JIDs get a single domain (#13)
* **Baileys memory**: one shared `AsyncLocalStorage` for signal key transactions instead of one per socket, stopping growth with every reconnect (#14; port of WhiskeySockets/Baileys#2722)

### Chores

* Release images are no longer tagged `latest` (#8)

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-21)

### Fixes

* **Device pairing**: Baileys `7.0.0-rc.9` → `7.0.0-rc14` with a `patch-package` patch that handles WhatsApp's `companion_reg_refresh` notification and guards `link_code_companion_reg` without crypto fields, fixing intermittent "Couldn't link device" failures. rc14 also fixes CVE-2026-48063 (#4; backport of upstream evolution-foundation/evolution-api#2759, `5cdf3240`, vendoring WhiskeySockets/Baileys#2765 and #2602)
* **App-state sync keys**: the Prisma, Redis and provider-files auth states restore `app-state-sync-key` with `AppStateSyncKeyData.fromObject` so base64 key data is converted back to bytes (#5; upstream evolution-foundation/evolution-api#2685, `65b5acf3`)
* **Instance auth**: instance routes authorize the path `instanceName` and ignore a query override, preventing cross-instance access (#2; adapted from upstream evolution-foundation/evolution-api#2549, `7a55a2bf`)

### Chores

* Fork baseline from Evolution API 2.3.7
* Agentic setup: AGENTS.md, Claude skills and hooks, docs drift check, Makefile, fork CI (`purple-checks.yml`) and GHCR publishing on `v*` tags
* Vitest unit suite (150 tests) for our own data processing, run shuffled in CI with type-checking and linting; known bugs pinned as `KNOWN BUG` + `it.fails` (#6)
* `@lid` → phone JID resolution for `MESSAGES_UPSERT` extracted to `resolvePhoneRemoteJid`, behavior unchanged (#6)
* `lint-staged` 17 and CI on Node 24; dependency review allows GHSA-vfj7-8cjw-p6xm (`braces`, no patched release, reached only via `patch-package` at install time) (#6)
